Very preliminary hack at Qt bindings for gambit scheme.  Some notes:

* hello.scm is a basically an implementation of the first two
  tutorials from http://doc.trolltech.com/4.3/tutorial.html

* webkit.scm is a simple demo of the QWebView widget.

* bindings.cpp can be independent of scheme implementation, with all
  the implementation specific stuff going in bindings-<impl>.scm.

* Both bindings.cpp and bindings-<impl>.scm can probably be
  autogenerated from the qt headers once we decide on a standard
  mapping.

* I'd much rather use generic functions, eg:

(resize button 100 30)
rather than
(qwidget-resize button 100 30)

Unfortunately scheme doesn't support them, so we'd have to come up
with our own implementation (I feel this is an argument in favour of
CL).  Actually even with generic functions we'd probably want to
prefix them with qt- or something since scheme doesn't support
packages.

* The signals/slots implementation sucks, and is limited to signals
  and slots defined in C++ code.  This bit needs some thought.

* I've not yet tackled memory management.  Not sure if we can use the
  scheme garbage collector to reap C++ objects - if not we'll have to
  explicitly delete them (and hopefully find a pain-free way to do so
  at the right time).
